The **substrate** refers to the material on which the manuscript is written. One of the three p's generally makes up the substrate in the Islamicate world: **Papyrus**, **Parchment**, **Paper**. Among those, paper is far and away the most common substrate, though parchment also shows up.

### Parchment
Parchment is expensive. Since it is animal skin treated (often with lime) and scraped, it requires (lots of) animals that can be used for making books. Parchment pretty quickly went out of use in the Islamicate world once paper came on the scene in the 8th century. The hair side and the flesh side are distinguishable on parchment with the hair side being darker (yellowish) and showing follicle marks and the flesh side being whiter and smoother. These photos are of a low quality parchment. You can see the differences in the hair side (top) and flesh side (bottom).

### Paper
In the Islamicate world, paper basically comes in three general types:
- wove,
- visible laid lines only and
- visible laid and chain lines.

This refers to what you see when you hold a leaf up to light. Handmade papers generally have some sort of pattern you can see, the exception is wove paper which has no pattern. Other papers generally have **chain lines** (wider spaced lines) and **laid lines**, also called water lines (narrowly spaced lines). These lines are a result of the mold on which the paper is made. This photo with labels shows a detail of laid and chain lines and a watermark.

**Indo-Persian handmade paper** generally has laid lines only, so only the closely-spaced lines. This type of paper was made on a reed or grass mold and was used all over the Eastern portion of the Islamicate world even up to the 20th century. For a manuscript showing the process of papermaking in the Indo-Persian world and a description with modern pictures of how it is done, see the British Library's [post about a papermaking workshop they held](https://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/collectioncare/2015/04/making-islamic-style-paper.html).

**Syro-Egyptian handmade paper** tends to have chain lines in groups of two or three. As you can see in the photo below, they are running parallel to the text. This type of paper was used in the Islamicate world in the central region until the mid-15th century when it was replaced by European paper.

**European paper**, which was cheaper to import than it was to make paper locally, generally has evenly spaced chain lines and laid lines. It also often has watermarks, like what can be seen in the illustration below.

Watermarks on made-for-export European paper often involved crescent moons of some kind. A popular type of paper, 17th century and after, was known as a trelune for the three crescent moon watermark.

### Collation

Codices are made up of stacks of folded leaves. A leaf folded in half is called a **bifolium**, when put into a stack and then folded, you get a **quire or gathering**. Those quires are stacked one atop the other and sewn in two or four **stations**. It is common to find quires of 5 bifolia which means 10 leaves and 20 pages. This illustration from Adam Gacek's *Arabic Manuscripts* may help you visualize it. The illustration also shows how a single leaf **(singleton)** can be added to a bifolium to make a set of three leaves. In the illustration, "f." stands for folio, meaning leaf, and "p." stands for page, meaning one side of a leaf.

Here's a side view of a stack of quires. As you can see, there are two sewing stations, but both stations have had their sewing broken meaning that these quires slip around when the book is opened.
