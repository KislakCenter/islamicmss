This site, a part of the [Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies](https://schoenberginstitute.org/), was created to go along with the [Manuscripts of the Muslim World (MMW)](http://openn.library.upenn.edu/html/muslimworld_contents.html) project. It is meant to introduce novices to the basics of looking at Islamic manuscripts.

The MMW Project is a [CLIR](https://www.clir.org/)-funded project that cataloged and digitized Islamic manuscripts from [The Free Library of Philadelphia](https://www.freelibrary.org/), the [University of Pennsylvania Libraries](https://www.library.upenn.edu/), including the [Penn Museum](https://www.penn.museum/) and the [Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies](https://katz.sas.upenn.edu/), and [Columbia University Rare Book and Manuscript Library](https://library.columbia.edu/) and [The Burke Library at Union Theological Seminary](https://library.columbia.edu/libraries/burke.html).

Along the way, other repositories also allowed their manuscripts to be digitized, cataloged and included in the project. These further collections include items from the [American Philosophical Society](https://www.amphilsoc.org/), [Bryn Mawr College](https://www.brynmawr.edu/), [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/), [The Library Company of Philadelphia](https://librarycompany.org/), and the [Philadelphia Museum of Art](https://philamuseum.org/).
