Islamic manuscripts are, in large part, written in Perso-Arabic script languages which include Arabic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish, Urdu and other languages.

The script is read **right-to-left**, which means that when you open a book, the spine will be on the right and the fore-edge on the left. You then read from right-to-left.

The script itself is designed to be written joined as a cursive, which means that the letters will change shape slightly (or a lot) depending on where they are in the word. Each letter has 4 shapes: initial, medial, final and isolated (unconnected). You can see how this works with the letter *jim* in the picture below.

For Arabic, there are only 11 shapes for the letters, but there are 28 different letters. Points (dots) above and below the letters help distinguish between letters with the same shapes. See for example the three letters below (*ba*, *ta*, *tha*)

Each letter has the same basic shape, but they are distinguished by differing numbers of points above and below.

Another thing you might notice when looking at an Arabic, Persian, or Turkish manuscript is other marks floating above and below the line of text. These are **vowels** and they help you pronounce words correctly. Writing in vowels is not a requirement to be able to read the text, though, and many times they are left out of the copy since people who can read the languages know how to pronounce words without them. The one exception to this is the Qur'an, which is almost always copied with the vowels in place. Below is a page from a copy of the Qur'an. You can see the vowels as short lines, loops and an open circle above or short lines below the line of text. Do not confuse vowels with the points (dots) on the letters. These are two different things and serve different functions.

Please also note about Perso-Arabic script that there are **no** capital letters and no necessary punctuation. There are no paragraphs and no fancy opening letters. In order to navigate a text, therefore, rubrications and overlining become important. **Rubrications** are words in another color (red, most often) or in a slightly larger size that help a reader figure out where something new begins. **Overlining** is like underlining, but with the line on top. It also helps catch the reader's attention and direct their reading. A page with examples of both is below. You can see the red words and letters (rubrications) help the reader determine what kind of text this is (commentary) and where the source-text begins and ends. The overlining serves here to highlight quotations. Another type of red mark, an overline with a little circle at one end which is particular to this copy, works like a footnote marker drawing the reader's attention to the marginal notes. See if you can find all three types of mark in the image below.

That's a very basic intro to Perso-Arabic script. You can do the [**Basics exercise**](https://forms.gle/M66q8gTwXBcuRMtS9) now, or continue to other pages as you like.
