Islamicate manuscripts are generally laid out in one column with fairly wide margins on the three outer sides for marginal commentary and notes. The exception to this rule is poetry, which is generally written in two or more columns. Lines and columns are generally ruled in blind (without ink) so that when the scribe copies the text, the lines come out straight.

### Prose

Below is an example of a fairly standard **prose** layout with wide margins all around and marginal lines and annotations.

From the same manuscript, here's a photo of rules in blind. These were made using a frame rule (mistarah), or ruling board which is a piece of card with threads sewn onto it that mark the lines. It is then put under a page and rubbed over with a smoothing device to create indentations in the page. Those indentations are the line rules.

### Poetry

For **poetry**, lines are laid out in columns. Often, the columns are ruled in ink to keep everything tidy. Here is an example from a copy of the Shahnamah held at the Free Library of Philadelphia.

### Other layout features

**Rubrications**, which you can see in red and blue in the image above, help direct your reading; they help draw the eye to guide words, or section divisions. They are often in red, but sometimes in other colors like blue, green, and gold. Sometimes, rubrications are in a larger script.

**Color** can help in other ways, too. For example, sometimes, poetry will be mixed in with prose, but it is still usually set off by some kind of marker. This can be words (the actual word 'verse' or 'poem' before a poem begins), or rulings, or simple sets of three red dots in between each line. Other aspects of color can indicate something about genre as well. For example, commentaries often have the **source-text in red and the commentary in black** as in the left-hand image below. The right-hand image shows another way of distinguishing source-text from commentary using **overlining**, which is, as it sounds, putting lines over a word. In the image below, the call-out boxes show enlarged details of the source-text in red (left) and the overlining (right).

Another aspect of layout that we frequently see in Islamicate manuscripts are **catchwords** which often appear on the back of every page, usually in the lower margin toward the left side. The catchword is a repetition of the word that will appear at the top of the next page. Since manuscript pages are generally not numbered, the catchwords help keep pages in order. In the image below, you can see the catchword enlarged with a blue arrow pointing to the corresponding first word on the next page. Those two words should match and here they do.

A final aspect of layout that you most often see in poetry, are **lines set at angles** so that they take up more room on the page. This helps to manipulate spacing of the text so that an illustration can appear where you want it to appear in relation to what the text is saying. Angled lines are also used simply to take up more space on the page for any reason. For example, near the end of a text so you don't end up with one line straggling onto the next page, final pages will be set with the lines at angles so that the pages look neat. An example is below.
