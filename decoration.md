Decoration includes illumination, illustration, diagram and anything else that is not text or notes. We can think of **illumination** as functional beautifiers that we find in manuscripts. **Illustration**, on the other hand, is paintings showing a scene from a tale that is in the book or that reflects something about the production of it. **Diagrams** are one category of illustration and are mostly found in scientific texts.

### Illumination

Illumination has several possible functions. It can show where texts begin and end. It can show internal text divisions. It can help direct the reader's attention. It can serve as filler for spaces on the page left open by the text. It can also simply be a place for the illuminator to show off their skill. Illumination does not need to involve the use of gold leaf; it is decorative in whatever way that means for the producer. Below is an example of illuminations in the page. This page opening has a headpiece with geometric shapes and a title, marginal fill of animals and plants around the entire page-opening, cloudbands in which the text appears and text dividers that show where a new portion of the text begins.

The above page is quite elaborately illuminated, but illumination does not always look so fancy. Often, you will find just a headpiece, or a suggestion of a headpiece and nothing else decorative in the manuscript besides rubrications, if that. An example of a very simple headpiece that someone probably drew in later is below.

It is worth noting that the vocabulary for describing illumination in Islamicate manuscripts is rather unstable. People tend to use either English words brought over from describing Western manuscripts, or they use  Persian or Turkish words. There is little agreement on how description should be done. As an example of one way to describe illumination, here is Carine Juvin's description of the frontispiece of a juz' (1 part of 30) from a Mamluk Qur'an found in the Louvre. The Penn Museum has another juz' from this same set, so we can look at that image, while reading her description. Read the description first and see if you can visualize what she's saying. Then scroll down to the image.
>"The frontispiece or title page (folio 1a) contains a rectangular panel with three registers delimited by a knotted chain pattern in gold paint. The square central register contains an empty multifoil medallion outlined by two continuous intersecting strips. The spandrels have floral motifs: stems and leaves in gold paint, blue lotus buds with either one lobe or three, pink lotus buds with four lobes, and blue rosettes with three gold petals, all on a black background. The interstices formed by the two strips have a lapis blue background on which a plant motif appears, composed of a green fleuron with three lobes between two gold half- palmettes. The two oblong bands above and below the central register contain the title…The entire panel is outlined by blue framing lines with a lancet projecting from each corner. On the left side it is extended out from the border by three illuminated vignettes." (pp. 109-110 from: “A Mamluk Qurʾānic Ǧuzʾ and Its Connection with Amīr ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Ǧazāʾirī,” in *Journal of Islamic Manuscripts* 10.1 (2019): 105-135.)

For another take on how to describe illuminations, see this [**blog post from the British Library**](https://blogs.bl.uk/asian-and-african/2019/08/emanating-light-illumination-in-islamic-manuscripts.html) about illuminations in Islamic manuscripts. In it, the author very kindly lists both the English and Persian/Turkish vocabulary for describing items.

### Illustration

Illustrations show a scene in the text. Occasionally, it will show something associated with the transmission of a text. And sometimes, **albums** are made up of illustrations that may or may not have connections one to the next. If you go to OPenn, you can see examples of these latter types of collections. There are two examples linked below for you to explore.
- [**Deccani portrait album showing images of Mughal rulers, Deccani kings and Safavid shahs**](http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/0023/html/lewis_o_191.html) Free Library of Philadelphia, Lewis O 191 on OPenn.
- [**Illustration and calligraphic album collecting a variety of loose leaf drawings and framing them so they match**](http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/0032/html/X892_8_M31.html) Columbia University RBML, X892.8 M31 on OPenn.

Primarily, however, illustrations show scenes from a story, as do the two images below. You can see in both of these images how the image overflows the border-rules making use of more of the page. You may also notice the architectural detail in the right-hand image. Although perspective is not generally used in these paintings, you can tell how far objects are supposed to be from you, the viewer, based on where they fall on the page. Lower on the page is closer to you, higher on the page is farther away.

You may also notice a few lines of text in both images. That text goes with the image, so the spacing of the lines on the previous pages need to be arranged so that the line of text that goes with the image ends up in the correct place on this page. (See *angled lines* in the [**Layout**](/islamicmss/layout/) page for more information).

Illustrations can also be rather schematic, as are some versions of the illustrations in the popular prayer book *Dala'il al-Khayrat*. In the illustration below, the Prophet Muhammad's mosque is represented by the lamp and the stairs (minbar).

### Diagrams

Finally, we have diagrams which range greatly in detail and skill.  Diagrams are found primarily in scientific texts including astronomical, astrological, medical, mathematical and others. Below are pages with diagrams, one from a geometry text (left) and one from an astronomy text (right).

### Conclusion

As you can perhaps tell from the above images, traditionally, text is written first and spaces are left for illustration, diagrams, and illumination. They are added later, often by another worker. Since that is the case, you find, not infrequently, manuscripts that are missing diagrams, illustrations and illuminations. Blank spaces will be left for someone to fill in later, or just left blank forever. A fine example of that is the *Shahnamah* at Bryn Mawr College Libraries [**BV65**](http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/0003/html/bv_065.html).You can scroll through that manuscript on OPenn and see that there are some [complete illustrations](http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/0003/bv_065/data/web/9780_0451_web.jpg), some [partially finished illustrations](http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/0003/bv_065/data/web/9780_0869_web.jpg), and some [blanks](http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/0003/bv_065/data/web/9780_0079_web.jpg) where illustrations would have gone.

Decoration is a large topic. This page only begins to brush the surface. See the [Bibliography](/islamicmss/bibliography/) for other places to search for resources. That concludes the introduction to decoration.  Do the [**Decoration exercise**](https://forms.gle/1PggtuVpLKD6WkGZ9) now, or jump to any other page you like.
