This site holds **basic** information and resources relating to  the study of Islamic manuscripts. If you are new to thinking about the material aspects of Islamic manuscripts or are simply curious and want to know more, then this site is for you!

### **Organization**

 There are 7 content pages: [**Basics**](/islamicmss/basics/), [**Binding**](/islamicmss/binding/), [**Substrate**](/islamicmss/substrate/), [**Layout**](/islamicmss/layout/), [**Scripts**](/islamicmss/scripts/), [**Decoration**](/islamicmss/decoration/), [**Notes**](/islamicmss/notes/).

 At the bottom of each page (except Notes) is a link to a short exercise that will let you test your knowledge. You can also access any of the exercises from the [**Exercises**](/islamicmss/exercises) page.

 Finally, the [**Glossary**](/islamicmss/glossary/) page has photos of particular aspects of manuscripts that may be of use to you and the [**References**](/islamicmss/references/) page has links and resources for further research.

### **Things to Know**

As you work through these pages, keep in mind that manuscript making was a team effort and included papermakers, scribes,  and binders at the very least. Fancy, or deluxe, manuscript production would also include (teams of) illustrators and illuminators.

You can find digital collections of Islamic manuscripts used on this website in [**OPenn**](http://openn.library.upenn.edu/html/muslimworld_contents.html), which hosts over 500 open-access, high-resolution digitized Islamic manuscripts from Philadelphia area collections and Columbia University. All images on this site are open access under Creative Commons licenses and have been taken from OPenn, unless otherwise stated.

### **Where to Start**

If you are *unfamiliar* with Perso-Arabic script, please start with the [**Basics**](/islamicmss/basics/) page, if you *are* familiar with it, then choose any other page to begin.


Happy learning.
