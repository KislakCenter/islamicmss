Manuscript notes are anything that someone writes in the manuscript that is not part of the text being copied or decorations that go with it. Manuscript notes can be divided into three basic categories:
- Legal notes,
- Textual notes,
- Unrelated notes.

### Legal notes
Legal notes are notes that have anything to do with the material manuscript as a physical object. They would include owner's notes, buyer's notes, seller's notes, borrower's names, library stamps, waqf (endowment) notes, etc. In the image below, you can see a number of owner's notes and a stamp. It is fairly common to find such notes and stamps on the flyleaves of books.

Another type of legal note that can be found in manuscripts are **waqf notes**, which are endowment or pious donation notes.  These types of notes usually say what the item being donated is, who is giving it, to whom, when and for how long. Two examples of waqf notes are below. If you need larger images to be able to read the notes, you can find them on OPenn (links are below the images).

### Textual notes

Textual notes are any notes that have to do with the text of the manuscript. They include reader's notes, collation notes, text emendations, marginalia regarding the text, etc. The example below contains a reader's note in red saying when he read the copy. The colophon, which you might expect to be in the triangle shape, is actually over to the left in black.

### Unrelated notes

Unrelated notes are notes and drawings that seemingly have nothing to do with the manuscript at all. These include lists of births and deaths, recordings of major events, doodles, shopping lists, prices for things other than the book in hand, etc. Below are some birth notes found in the back of a devotional book. These notes do not have anything to do with the text or with the book as an object, exactly, though they can sometimes tell us things about where the codex was located or who had it. In that sense, they may be thought to fall under the 'legal notes' category. For that reason, the 'unrelated' category is sometimes not really considered a category, and we end up with simply legal notes and textual notes.

### Stamps

Stamps, or seals, are ink or embossed stamps of an owner, library, or reader that are left on the pages of the book. They can be quite tricky to read since it is not always evident in what order the words go. Sometimes they have a date on them, but often they are just a name. Stamps will frequently be in more than one place in the book meaning that if one is not clear, another may be more crisp and easier to read. You can see this in the image below where the stamp at the back (on the right) is not very well-stamped, but the one at the front (on the left and then enlarged in the middle) is much clearer. Sometimes, a stamp does not say a name at all, but instead offers blessings.

### Conclusion

Manuscript notes can tell us much about where a manuscript has traveled, how it was used, for how long it was used, in whose libraries it resided, whether it differs from other copies a reader has seen. Unfortunately, since manuscript notes were often written for the then-owner of the manuscript, they are in informal script. As such, they are often very difficult to read.

That concludes the Notes section. There is no activity to go with this section, so please continue to any other page now. Or, if you are finished, go to the [Xercises](/islamicmss/exercises/) page and do the cumulative exercise.
